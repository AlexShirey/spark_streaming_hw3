Spark streaming task, implementation

app structure:
	folders:
		data - input data in csv format to proccess
		notebook - contains notebook to import into zeppelin
		results - screenshots of task execution - spark UI, kafka, logs
		src - sources and tests
	files:
		readme.md - current file
		pom.xml - pom file with dependencies
						
			
to run the app (windows 10):

pre requirements:
 - kafka 0.10.0.0 ( kafka_2.11-0.10.0.0.tgz)
 - zeppelin 0.7.2 released on Jun 12, 2017, binary package with all interpreters
 - zeppelin notebook (import from notebook\zeppelin\anomaly-detector-kafka.json)
 - zeppelin interpreter to use in notebook
 
	1. start zookeeper
		> kafka_dir\bin\windows\zookeeper-server-start.bat config\zookeeper.properties
	2. start kafka
		> kafka_dir\bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat config\server.properties
	3. create topics (if not exists)
		> kafka_dir\bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 10 --topic monitoring20
		> kafka_dir\bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic monitoringEnriched2
	4. start zeppelin
		> zeppelin_dir\bin\zeppelin.cmd
	5. start streaming application (com.epam.bdcc.spark.AnomalyDetector) in IDE, to wait for incoming data.
	6. start visualizer prototype in zeppelin (localhost:8080 by default):
		- Start "Visualizer Section".
		- Start "Streaming Section".
		- Use "Stop Streaming Application" to stop streaming section.
	7. run the com.epam.bdcc.kafka.TopicGenerator in IDE, to fill in raw Kafka topic.
	8. zeppelin "Streaming Section" should show changing data
	9. you can visit Spark UI page (localhost:4040 by default) to check streaming jobs	
	
this app was run with following configuration (see src\main\resources\conf\config.properties):

	batch duration - 5 seconds
	batch size - 150 records
	batch sleep - 1000 ms
		
	so, kafka is recieving records with 150 rec/sec rate,
	each 5 seconds new batch (RDD) is proccessed - each record is enriched by HTMNetwork, 
	then records are sent to Kafka "monitoringEnriched2" topic,
	where they are finally grabbed by zeppelin spark streaming app and vizualized.
	
	with this settings app is stable - batch duration <  total delay (Scheduling Delay + processing time)
			
		

//original task description
Realtime Anomaly Detection
==========================

This project is a prototype for real time anomaly detection.
The general idea is
    - to stream the data from one Kafka topic,
    - to enrich the records with anomaly markers and to stream those to second Kafka topic,
    - finally, to stream the data from the second topic to Apache Zeppelin and visualize it.
To detect and mark anomalies in the data stream, we use [Numenta's Hierarchical Temporal Memory](https://numenta.org/) -  a technology which emulates the work of the cortex.

# What is done
    - Everything concerning the intellectual part - the HTM network.
    - Spark steaming application which takes the input stream from Kafka, detects anomalies using online learning and outputs enriched records back into Kafka.
    - Prototype of visualization based on zeppelin notebook.

# What to do
Fill out the missing sections in the code, following the TODO comments.
    - The main data class is MonitoringRecord. This is the content of both Kafka topics.
    - First topic shall be filled out by code you write in the TopicGenerator class.
    - Enrichment of the data and streaming to the second topic is to be implemented in the AnomalyDetector class.
    - Zeppelin notebook for reading and visualizing the data from the second topic is ready, the setup is provided below.
    - You shall also implemenent the data partitioner for MonitoringRecords, and serializer/deserializer for the SparkStreaming state, represented by our HTMNetwork instance.
    - Don't forget about the tests.

# Other possible improvements
    - Optimise parameters and select best properties for real life run
    - Fix maven to not include the properties into the final jar. Add exclude spark libraries from uber jar.

# Run sequence

## One time actions
Start Zookeeper, Kafka and Zeppelin.

If you have Windows, [here](https://dzone.com/articles/running-apache-kafka-on-windows-os) 
is a nice blog about how to run Kafka on Windows.

### Zookeeper
Run Zookeeper:
```
bin\zkServer.cmd
```

### Kafka
Run Kafka:
```
bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat .\config\server.properties
```

Create kafka topics called "monitoring20" and "monitoringEnriched2", e.g.:
```
bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 10 --topic monitoring20
bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic monitoringEnriched2
```

## Zeppelin
Run :
```
bin\zeppelin.cmd
```

Create spark2 interpreter from simple spark interpreter, by setting parameters like:
```
PYTHONPATH=%SPARK2_HOME%\python;%SPARK2_HOME%\python\lib\py4j-*-src.zip 
SPARK_HOME=%SPARK2_HOME%
SPARK_MAJOR_VERSION=2
spark.app.name=Zeppelin_Spark2
zeppelin.spark.enableSupportedVersionCheck=false 
```

Add following dependencies into spark2 interpreter:
```
org.apache.spark:spark-streaming-kafka-0-10_2.11:2.1.1
org.apache.kafka:kafka_2.11:0.10.2.1
org.apache.kafka:kafka-clients:0.10.2.1
org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.11:2.1.1
```

Import anomaly-detector-kafka.json notebook into Zeppelin.

In case of problems with Windows path - replace spark-submit on spark-submit2
in bin\interpreter.cmd for spark.

## Running the application during development cycle

1) Start streaming application (com.epam.bdcc.spark.AnomalyDetector), to wait for incoming data.

2) Start visualizer prototype in zeppelin:
    - Start "Visualizer Section".
    - Start "Streaming Section".
    - Use "Stop Streaming Application" to stop streaming section.

3) Run the com.epam.bdcc.kafka.TopicGenerator, to fill in raw Kafka topic.
It takes records from csv (data\one_device_2015-2017.csv) and puts them into raw Kafka topic. 
See records schema in com.epam.bdcc.htm.MonitoringRecord

![Graphs example](/notebook/img/graphs.png?raw=true "Running Example")

## Requirements
    Devices need to be persistently assigned to kafka topic partitions.
    Only one instance of HTMNetwork(deviceID) per devece (deviceID = com.epam.bdcc.kafka.KafkaHelper.getKey(MonitoringRecord)) can be instantinated in spark streaming application.
    The order of the entries for the device must be saved.
    Max batch duration is 10 seconds! (Ideal is 2-3 seconds)
    All batches must be processed in the allotted interval, the first (HTMNetwork initialization) batch is an exception.
    KafkaProducer & ConsumerStrategy must be the following types (KafkaProducer<String, MonitoringRecord> & ConsumerStrategy<String, MonitoringRecord>).
    Restore from checkpoint is mandatory.
    
## Hints
    https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-kafka-0-10-integration.html
    https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-programming-guide.html#performance-tuning
    Code entry point:
        - com.epam.bdcc.kafka.TopicGenerator (Kafka Record Generator).
        - com.epam.bdcc.spark.AnomalyDetector (Spark Streaming Anomaly Detector).
    Kryo serializer is several times faster than JSON Serializer.
    There are a lot of options to optimise spark streaming & kafka, like:
        - spark.streaming.kafka.maxRatePerPartition
        - spark.streaming.backpressure.enabled
        - spark.serializer
        - checkpointInterval
        - GC options
        - ...
    
## Acceptance criteria:
    Missing parts are filled in and work meets all requirements
    Screenshot of SparkUI showing the various stages and tasks (especialy Streaming)
    Please include Spark logs as well (modify log4j.properties)
